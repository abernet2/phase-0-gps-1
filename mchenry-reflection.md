**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

>I still struggle a little bit with remembering the exact order of operations in the run up to a pull request and afterward. I also was not exactly sure the difference between doing a pull versus doing a fetch and merge.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

>The GPS let me experience my first-ever merge conflict. All my previous git experience had been me alone committing code to myself, so I'd never seen nor resolved one. Our guide also helped clarify that there's not much difference between a fetch and merge and a pull request, and that 99 out of 100 times a git pull works. We also spent a long time discussing how you might implement a good git workflow by dividing up work to minimize merge conflicts as much as possible.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

>My pair and I asked the guide about the differences between using pull versus fetch and merge. Our guide also went through a handy shortcut to getting command line history. I asked my pair about how whitespace inconsistencies could cause merge conflicts and how git actually stores what's been changed from commit to commit.

**What still confuses you about git?**

>I feel like I'm coming closer and closer to having a good handle on being able to go through an entire pull request without glancing at my cheat sheet, and doing it one more time here helped. At first I didn't fully get the order, and it was easy to drop a step, but it's getting easier. Git does still feel a bit like strange magic, and I sort of want to go down the rabbit hole of figuring out just how it does what it does when it works.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

>A little nerve-racking, but rewarding. It was the first experience of any pairing at all for both my pair and I, so we were figuring out an awful lot at once. I worry a bit that I talked too much and too fast from nerves, but we did get some good discussion and work out of it.
