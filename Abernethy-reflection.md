##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I realized doing my evaluations that I didn't have a good handle on forking repositories. Then through GPS I realized that I didn't fully understand the cooperative aspect of github. 

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

My partner and I both didn't realize that the other person was supposed to approve the pull request, but actually walking through the steps we realized that it was a good way to check over the code. When we made mistakes we learned that if you push a new commit, it updates the pull request so you don't have to make a new pull request every time you catch a little bug.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked the guide about fetch, specifically when you fetch something, but don't merge it, where does that file live? is it on its own branch? Is it a new file in the repository until it is merged? We didn't answer that question, but I looked it up and I think it's a way to update remote tracking branches directly. Which is an extra feature, that seems like bad practice, in addition to fetch being half of what pull does.

##What still confuses you about git?

*I know Git stores changes to code, and not actual different versions of code. So if I have a hundred different commits, it takes up less space because I don't actuall store 100 different files, I store 100 different sets of instructions to get to those files. On the point, I don't understand the cons of using github vs subversion (which stores the entire file)

*I also still don't fully understand the merging, it seems like git is smart about some merges and not about others. In other words, I don't think it comapres line for line on every merge request, but I don't fully comprehend where the line of demarcation is. For instance, I have some experience in Java and in Java it doesn't matter where you add your function, but I'm worried if I add my function anywhere but the bottom it might be a hassle.

*When you create a new branch, that is still considered forking in the idea. Forking is a concept, not just a command on git for repositories. A review I corrected called github a repository of repositories, and I thought you could not merge repositories, but I found out you can. Everything has different names though. When you fetch a repository you fetch upstream, which I believe is another input for when the guide says <remote>.  So I guess this is a verbose way of saying the vocabulary and remote/local distinctions still confuse me, just not so much in the limited cases we have addressed.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was good! I never felt like my partner imposed or did too little. I feel like we cooperated and communicated pretty well. My initial thought was that navigating would be kind of useless on this specific excercise. I thought it'd basically just be reading the instructions, but I actually it was pretty helpful to have someone to verify you're doing the right thing and if the text might have been ambiguous I would not have known. So I was pleasantly surprised by how effective the division of labor seemed to be.
